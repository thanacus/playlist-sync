# playlist-sync
Syncs down playlists from compendiums into the current game via context menu

# Usage
Right-click a folder within a Playlist compendium and select "Synchronize to Playlists". This module will then look at each playlist within the compendium and take one of two actions:

- If the playlist is found within your game, it will remove all tracks from the game then add all tracks found in the compendium
- If the playlist is not found within your game, it will import the playlist into your game
